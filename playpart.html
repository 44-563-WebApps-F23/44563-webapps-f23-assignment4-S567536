           <p class="direction"> [After a pause, suddenly sits up in her chair, and listens eagerly. Then
            she sinks back again wearily, moaning to herself.] </p> yet!--Oh God--oh
            God--not yet!
            
            
              BERTA slips cautiously in by the hall door.  She has a letter in
              her hand.
        </p>
        <h6 class="BERTA">BERTA</h6>
        <p class="speech">
            Yes, when I saw that a certain person had come back to town--and that he
            went off with them. For we've heard enough about that gentleman before
            now.</p>
        <h6 class="HEDDA">HEDDA</h6>
        <p class="speech">
            Indeed?
            <p class="direction"> [Looks at the address.] </p> Why yes, it's addressed in Aunt Julia's
            hand. Well then, he has remained at Judge Brack's. And as for Eilert
            Lovborg--he is sitting, with vine-leaves in his hair, reading his
            manuscript.</p>
        <h6 class="BERTA">BERTA</h6>
        <p class="speech">    
            Bless me--I'll make up the fire at once.
            <p class="direction"> [She rakes the embers together
            and lays a piece of wood upon them; then stops and listens.] 
            </p>
            That was a
            ring at the front door, ma'am.

        <h6 class="MRSELVSTED">MRS. ELVSTED</h6>
        <p class="speech">
            Thanks; then I'll try. 
            <p class="direction">
                [She goes off to the inner room.]<br>
            
                 [HEDDA goes up to the glass door and draws back the curtains.
                   The broad daylight streams into the room.  Then she takes a
                   little hand-glass from the writing-table, looks at herself
                   in it, and arranges her hair.  Next she goes to the hall
                   door and presses the bell-button.
            
            
              BERTA presently appears at the hall door.]</p>

        <p class="speech">
            It'll soon burn up.
            <p class="direction"> [She goes out by the hall door.]
            
                 [HEDDA kneels on the foot-rest and lays some more pieces of
                   wood in the stove.
            
            
               After a short pause, GEORGE TESMAN enters from the hall.  He
               steals on tiptoe towards the middle doorway and is about to
               slip through the curtains.]</p>

            Oh yes,--for once in a way. Especially the beginning of the evening; for
            then Eilert read me part of his book. We arrived more than an hour too
            early--fancy that! And Brack had all sorts of arrangements to make--so
            Eilert read to me.</p>
